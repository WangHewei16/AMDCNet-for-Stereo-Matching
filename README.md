# Census
Census and Census add smoothing filtering model about a stereo matching algorithm based on visual sensitive information
* ./Figure1.png: Comparison of different test results.
* ./Figure2.png: Visual sensitive area retention.
* ./Table1.png: The error matching rate obtained by various algorithms.
* ./Table2.png: Comparison results of different algorithms.
* ./Census/: This folder contains our model code.
* ./Census add smoothing filtering/: This folder contains our model code which add a soothing filter based on the Cencus model.
* ./Part 1-4 test data set and disparity map/: This folder contains test data and disparity map.
